## Intro
Ukraine is facing an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe. Violence is never an option â€“ promote peace, [donate or volunteer now](https://www.ukraine.who.foundation/?form=FUNWLUTAZDA).

Peace Chess is a small interactive experience, exploring how modifying chess rules can send a message and hopefully make visitors think about how their actions can contribute to a better work. Can we play chess in a way that keep everyone on the board?s
